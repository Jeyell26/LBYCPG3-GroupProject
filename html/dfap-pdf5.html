    <h1>ECE/CPE Research Ethics Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As members of the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and Computer Engineering (CPE) programs at De La Salle University, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of research ethics. Research ethics is integral to the pursuit of knowledge and the responsible conduct of research in our academic community.</p>

    <h2>Policy Statement</h2>
    <p>ECE/CPE students and faculty are expected to conduct research with the utmost integrity, transparency, and respect for human subjects, data, and intellectual property. The following principles govern research ethics in our department:</p>

    <h2>Respect for Human Subjects</h2>
    <p>All research involving human subjects must comply with the principles of informed consent, privacy, confidentiality, and protection of participants' rights and welfare. Researchers must obtain proper informed consent from participants before their involvement in any research study. Additionally, researchers should respect the privacy and confidentiality of participants' personal information and ensure that the data collected is used only for research purposes and reported in an anonymized manner when possible.</p>

    <h2>Integrity in Data Collection and Reporting</h2>
    <p>Researchers must maintain the highest standards of integrity in data collection, analysis, and reporting. All research data should be recorded accurately and truthfully, and any manipulation or falsification of data is strictly prohibited. Researchers should disclose any potential conflicts of interest that may arise during the research process and ensure that their findings are reported in an unbiased and transparent manner.</p>

    <h2>Responsible Use of Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Respect for intellectual property is essential in all research endeavors. Researchers should appropriately acknowledge and cite the work of others, including prior research, publications, and intellectual contributions. Plagiarism, unauthorized use of copyrighted materials, and improper attribution of ideas are strictly prohibited.</p>

    <h2>Animal Research and Ethical Treatment</h2>
    <p>If research involves the use of animals, researchers must adhere to the principles of ethical treatment and care of animals. All research involving animals should be conducted in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines for the welfare and humane treatment of animals.</p>
