    <h1>Computer Engineering Lab Safety Guidelines</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Computer Engineering Lab at De La Salle University. These safety guidelines have been developed to ensure the safety and well-being of all individuals working in the lab. It is of utmost importance to adhere to these guidelines to prevent accidents and protect yourself and others from potential hazards.</p>

    <h2>General Safety Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): All individuals must wear appropriate PPE, including safety goggles, lab coats, closed-toe shoes, and any additional gear required for specific experiments.</li>
        <li>Lab Access: Access to the lab is strictly restricted to authorized personnel only. Never permit unauthorized individuals to enter the lab.</li>
        <li>Emergency Preparedness: Familiarize yourself with the location of emergency exits, fire extinguishers, safety showers, and first-aid kits.</li>
        <li>Chemical Handling: Adhere to proper procedures for the handling and disposal of chemicals. Store chemicals in designated areas with clear labeling.</li>
        <li>Electrical Safety: Exercise extreme caution when dealing with electrical equipment. Inspect cords and plugs for any damage before use.</li>
        <li>Equipment Usage: Use lab equipment solely for their intended purposes and after receiving proper training.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Specific Safety Guidelines</h2>

        <li>
            <h3>Fire Safety</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fire Prevention: Keep flammable materials away from heat sources and open flames.</li>
                <li>Fire Extinguishers: Familiarize yourself with the location and usage of fire extinguishers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Reporting Incidents</h2>
    <p>If you witness or are involved in any lab incidents, no matter how minor, report them immediately to the lab supervisor or designated authority.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By following these Computer Engineering Lab Safety Guidelines, we can foster a safe and productive environment for all. Safety is a collective responsibility, and we must all play our part in ensuring the well-being of everyone in the lab. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to your lab instructor or supervisor.</p>
